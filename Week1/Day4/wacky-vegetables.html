      <h1>Wild and Wacky Vegetables</h1>
      <p>Black radishes are more commonly found in Europe, but can also be found within the United States at select specialty grocery stores or local farmers markets. They have a very pungent flavor and aroma, kind of like a horseradish.</p>
      <p>You definitely don't want to eat them raw like a carrot. They can however, be shredded or diced included in salads or other veggie mixes for to add a bit of bite. They can also be roasted and doused with butter to make them more palatable.</p>
